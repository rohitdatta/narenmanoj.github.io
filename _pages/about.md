Hi, I’m Naren. I’m a third year PhD student at the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://ttic.edu), a philanthropically endowed CS research institution located on the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu) campus with close ties to [UChicago computer science](https://cs.uchicago.edu). I’m fortunate to be advised by [Avrim Blum](https://home.ttic.edu/~avrim/) and [Yury Makarychev](https://home.ttic.edu/~yury/). As of Fall 2021, I am generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I’m interested in convex and high-dimensional geometry and its applications to theoretical computer science and machine learning theory. I’m also interested in the foundations of data science; my goals include building a better theoretical understanding of machine learning methods and developing practical machine learning and optimization algorithms with provable guarantees.

I graduated with my BS from the [UT Austin computer science department](https://cs.utexas.edu) in 2018. I spent the following year interning at several companies in New York and the Bay Area.
